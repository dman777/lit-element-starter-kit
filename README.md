# lit-element-starter-kit

To get going:
* To install run `npm install`
* To run `npm run dev`

Notes:
* Serves native ES6 modules straight to the browser with no transpiling! 
* Includes tool to resolve bare module imports for use in the browser
* By default runs on `port 5000`, feel free to change this in `bs-config.js`
* Includes live reload with browser sync

* Runs on Linux/Unix/Mac. Mileage may vary on Windows because of file system path differences. If using Windows, may want to use Windows WSL.
